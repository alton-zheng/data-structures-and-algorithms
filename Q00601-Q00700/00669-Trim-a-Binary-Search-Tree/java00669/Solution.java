 *
 * 669. Trim a Binary Search Tree #97
 *
 * Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.
 *
 * Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
 * Output: [1,null,2]
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3
 * Output: [3,2,null,1]
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: root = [1], low = 1, high = 2
 * Output: [1]
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: root = [1,null,2], low = 1, high = 3
 * Output: [1,null,2]
 * Example 5:
 *
 * Input: root = [1,null,2], low = 2, high = 4
 * Output: [2]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree in the range [1, 104].
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 104
 * The value of each node in the tree is unique.
 * root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
 * 0 <= low <= high <= 104
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
 *
 * Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Trim a Binary Search Tree.
 * Memory Usage: 42.5 MB, less than 8.29% of Java online submissions for Trim a Binary Search Tree.
